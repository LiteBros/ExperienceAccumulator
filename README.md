The mvp should help plan a 2-3 day trip to NYC to:
1. Have a locals experience
2. Experience the city for the first time i.e. touristy.

    * Family/couple looking to have a tourists experience.

- [ ] Choose SaaS product to build website i.e. wix, squarespace, goDaddy etc

- [ ] Research how to do marketing

- [ ] Research how to do analytics (google analytics)

## Data Collection
- Need to have blogs on the platform to serve information to the users.
- Attract blogs by stating we can help by:
    * Blog making i.e. designing of the blog and hosting **this can also be outsourced to existing 3rd party website makers like Squarespace, Wix and GoDaddy**
    * Driving **revenue** by sharing income of advertisements
- The **question** arises: should the MVP be targeted to bloggers then?
    * Take existing blogger
    * Tell them you will increase revenue
    * Put ads on facebook, google, twitter etc targeting same people and increase SEO?
    * More clicks => goal is met
